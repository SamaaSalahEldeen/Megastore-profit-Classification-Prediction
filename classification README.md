Megastore Profit Classification over view
The goal of this project is to predict the likelihood of returns in a megastore based on various features such as sales, discount, and delivery time. The dataset is preprocessed, features are engineered, and different classification models are trained and evaluated.

Dataset Analysis and Cleaning:
The code loads a dataset from a CSV file, displays some initial rows, and checks for missing values using missingno library.
Duplicates are removed from the dataset.
Date columns are converted to datetime format.
A new feature "time to deliver" is created based on the order and ship dates.
Main categories and sub-categories are extracted from the 'CategoryTree' column.
Various date-related features are extracted from the 'Order Date' and 'Ship Date' columns.


Model Training and Testing:
Classification models such as Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, XGBoost, SVM, GMM, and RandomForest are trained and evaluated.
Hyperparameter tuning is performed for some models using GridSearchCV.
Ensemble models, including a StackingClassifier, are trained and tested.
Overfitting analysis using cross-validation and accuracy scores is performed.
